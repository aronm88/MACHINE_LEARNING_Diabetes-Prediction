# Prediction of Diabetes Using Machine Learning

Kaggle dataset used in the project can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

The aim of the project is to predict whether a person will develop diabetes based on several factors.
The project uses three classification machine learning algorithms:
- Logistic regression
- Decision tree
- Random forest

<br>
The project includes some common techniques used while working with machine learning algorithms: <br>

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
- Standardization
- Principal component analysis (PCA)
- Pipelines
- Cross validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model assessment
